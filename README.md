## Status

🟢 Production Ready | 🤖 Agent Discoverable | 🚀 v2.2.0
**Agent Readiness: 9.0/10**
Date: 2025-11-08

## The Problem

AI agents pay for x402 APIs but have **zero recourse** when services fail:
- Server errors (503, 500, 502) from overload or bugs
- Empty responses from timeouts or crashes
- Service downtime during maintenance or outages

**Your USDC is gone forever.** x402 has no refund mechanism. ([GitHub Issue #508](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/issues/508))

APIs fail constantly - not from fraud, but from normal operational issues. Your agents shouldn't lose money when this happens.

## Our Solution

**API Failure Insurance for x402 Agents:**

Pay a 1% premium → Get coverage (up to $0.1 USDC per claim) → If API fails, instant refund

✅ **1% Percentage Premium** - Pay only 1% of your coverage amount
✅ **Up to 100x Protection** - Get 100% coverage for just 1% cost
✅ **Instant USDC Refunds** - Get your money back in 15-30 seconds
✅ **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Failure verification using zkEngine SNARKs
✅ **Agent Discoverable** - Full x402 Bazaar compatibility
✅ **Public Auditability** - Anyone can verify we paid legitimate claims
✅ **Privacy-Preserving** - Service identity & API content stay private
✅ **x402 Native (prototype)** - Minimal payment verification for testing

## How It Works

### The Insurance Flow

```
1. Agent chooses coverage amount (e.g., 0.01 USDC) for their API call
   → Pays 1% premium TO US (e.g., 0.0001 USDC)
   → Policy created for 24 hours
                    ↓
2. Agent pays X USDC TO MERCHANT (via x402)
   → Merchant receives payment (they keep it regardless)
   → Example: Agent pays 0.01 USDC for API call
                    ↓
3. API/Service fails: Returns 503 error / empty response / goes offline
                    ↓
4. Agent submits claim with HTTP response data
                    ↓
5. zkEngine analyzes the HTTP response and generates zero-knowledge proof (~15s)
   → Cryptographically certifies failure conditions were met (e.g., status >= 500)
   → Without exposing actual response data—like proving you know a password
     without revealing the password itself
                    ↓
6. Proof verified → We pay agent X USDC FROM OUR RESERVES
   → Service keeps their payment, we absorb the loss
   → Example: Agent receives 0.01 USDC refund (100% of coverage)
                    ↓
7. Public proof published on-chain
   → Anyone can verify we paid a legitimate claim
```

**Pricing Model:**
- **Percentage Premium**: 1% of coverage amount
- **Max Coverage**: 0.1 USDC per claim (ideal for micropayment protection)
- **Duration**: 24 hours

**Examples:**
- **0.01 USDC coverage** → 0.0001 USDC premium (1%) = 100x protection
- **0.05 USDC coverage** → 0.0005 USDC premium (1%) = 100x protection
- **0.1 USDC coverage** → 0.001 USDC premium (1%) = 100x protection

**Important:** This is insurance (we pay from reserves), not chargebacks (reversing service payment). From the agent's perspective, the outcome is the same: money back when the API fails to deliver.

### Solving the Agent Memory Problem

**Challenge:** AI agents have limited context windows and may forget their policy_id between insurance purchase and claim filing (could be hours or days later).

**Solution:** Wallet-based policy lookup
- Agents can always access their wallet address (it's fundamental to their identity)
- GET /policies?wallet=0x... returns all active policies for that wallet
- No need to store policy_id - just remember your wallet address
- Query anytime to find policies and file claims

**Why this matters:**
- Agents don't need to maintain state between purchase and claim
- Works even after context window resets or system restarts
- Enables autonomous claim filing without human intervention
- Compatible with all agent frameworks (no special storage required)

### Failure Detection Rules

**We issue refunds when services:**
- Return HTTP status >= 500 (server errors: 500, 502, 503, 504)
- Return empty response body (0 bytes)
- Become unresponsive or timeout

**We do NOT refund when:**
- HTTP 200-299 (successful responses, even if content is unexpected)
- HTTP 400-499 (client errors - agent's fault)
- Response has content (service delivered something)

**This covers normal operational failures:** server overload, crashes, maintenance, bugs, network issues - not malicious behavior.

### Why Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

**Problem:** How do we prove an API failed without exposing private data?

**Solution:** zkEngine SNARKs prove the failure mathematically

**What gets proven (public):**
- ✅ HTTP status was >= 500 OR body length was 0
- ✅ Failure detection logic executed correctly
- ✅ Payout amount ≤ policy coverage
- ✅ Agent had an active policy

**What stays private (hidden):**
- 🔒 Actual API response content
- 🔒 Service URL/identity (only hash visible)
- 🔒 HTTP headers and metadata
- 🔒 Business logic details

**Three Key Benefits:**

1. **Public Auditability** - Anyone can verify we're paying legitimate claims (prevents us from abuse)
2. **Privacy Preservation** - Service identity protected, no public shaming for downtime
3. **Trustless Verification** - Math proves failure, not our word (future: fully on-chain)

**Technology:** zkEngine with Nova/Spartan SNARKs on Bn256 curve

See [AGENT_DISCOVERY.md](AGENT_DISCOVERY.md) for complete integration guide.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Lookup Active Policies (Solves Agent Memory Problem)

**NEW: Find your policies when you need to file a claim**

This endpoint solves the "agent memory problem" - agents with limited context windows can forget their policy_id between purchase and claim filing. Simply query with your wallet address to retrieve all active policies.

```bash
GET /policies?wallet=0x...

Response:
{
  "wallet_address": "0x...",
  "active_policies": [
    {
      "policy_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "merchant_url": "https://api.example.com",
      "coverage_amount": 10000,
      "premium": 100,
      "status": "active",
      "created_at": "2025-11-07T10:00:00Z",
      "expires_at": "2025-11-08T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "total_coverage": 10000,
  "claim_endpoint": "/claim",
  "note": "Use policy_id from any active policy to file a claim if merchant fails"
}
```

**Usage in Agent Flow:**
```python
# When merchant fails and you need to file a claim:
# 1. Get your wallet address (you always know this)
my_wallet = agent.wallet.address

# 2. Lookup your active policies
policies = httpx.get(f"http://localhost:8000/policies?wallet={my_wallet}").json()

# 3. Find the policy for the failed merchant
policy = next(p for p in policies["active_policies"]
              if p["merchant_url"] == failed_merchant_url)

# 4. File claim with the policy_id
claim = httpx.post("http://localhost:8000/claim", json={
    "policy_id": policy["policy_id"],
    "http_response": {"status": 503, "body": ""}
})
```

### 2. Create Insurance Policy (x402 Payment Required)

**Important:** This endpoint requires a valid x402 payment. Without payment, you'll receive a 402 Payment Required response with payment details.

```bash
POST /insure
Headers:
  X-PAYMENT: <base64-encoded x402 payment>
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "merchant_url": "https://api.example.com",
  "coverage_amount": 10000
}

Response (with valid payment):
{
  "policy_id": "uuid",
  "agent_address": "0x...",
  "coverage_amount": 10000,
  "premium": 1000,
  "status": "active",
  "expires_at": "2025-11-07T10:00:00"
}

Response (without payment):
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "accepts": [{
    "network": "base",
    "maxAmountRequired": "1000000000",
    "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
    "payTo": "0xba72eD392dB9d67813D68D562D2d67c36fFF566b",
    ...
  }],
  "error": "No X-PAYMENT header provided"
}
```

### 2. Submit Fraud Claim

```bash
POST /claim
Body:
{
  "policy_id": "uuid",
  "http_response": {
    "status": 503,
    "body": "",
    "headers": {}
  }
}

Response:
{
  "claim_id": "uuid",
  "proof": "0xabc...",
  "public_inputs": [1, 503, 0, 10000],
  "payout_amount": 10000,
  "refund_tx_hash": "0x...",
  "status": "paid",
  "proof_url": "/proofs/uuid"
}
```

### 3. Verify Proof (Public)

```bash
POST /verify
Body:
{
  "proof": "0xabc...",
  "public_inputs": [1, 503, 0, 10000]
}

Response:
{
  "valid": true,
  "fraud_detected": true,
  "payout_amount": 10000
}
```

### 4. Get Proof Data (Public)

```bash
GET /proofs/<claim_id>

Response:
{
  "claim_id": "uuid",
  "proof": "0xabc...",
  "public_inputs": [1, 503, 0, 10000],
  "http_status": 503,
  "payout_amount": 10000,
  "refund_tx_hash": "0x...",
  ...
}
```

## Agent Example

```python
import httpx

# 1. Buy insurance
policy = httpx.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/insure",
    headers={"X-Payment": "token=xyz,amount=100,signature=abc"},
    json={"merchant_url": "https://api.com", "coverage_amount": 0.01}
).json()

# 2. Make API call
response = httpx.get("https://api.com/data")

# 3. If fraud, file claim
if response.status_code >= 400 or response.text == "":
    claim = httpx.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/claim",
        json={
            "policy_id": policy["policy_id"],
            "http_response": {
                "status": response.status_code,
                "body": response.text,
                "headers": dict(response.headers)
            }
        }
    ).json()

    print(f"Refund issued: {claim['refund_tx_hash']}")
```

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/insure \
  -H "X-Payment: token=test,amount=1,signature=test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"merchant_url": "https://api.com", "coverage_amount": 50}'

# File a test claim
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/claim \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "policy_id": "POLICY_ID_FROM_ABOVE",
    "http_response": {
      "status": 503,
      "body": "",
      "headers": {}
    }
  }'
```

✅ Public auditability (proof verification endpoint)

## Why This Matters

### The Unsolved Problem

**[GitHub Issue #508](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/issues/508)** (Open since 2024)

Kyle Den Hartog (Brave Security) identified a critical gap:
> "The agent needs a way to request a chargeback as they paid for a product they didn't receive."

**Current situation:**
- x402 has NO refund mechanism when merchants fail
- Agents have NO protection against merchant fraud
- USDC payments are irreversible
- Community has been asking for a solution for over a year

**Our solution:** First production implementation of merchant failure insurance for x402

### What Makes This Different

**Insurance (what we built):**
- Agent pays premium to us → We pay refund from our reserves
- Merchant keeps their original payment
- We absorb the financial loss

**vs. Chargebacks (what doesn't exist):**
- Would reverse merchant's payment directly
- Merchant loses what they received
- Requires protocol-level support (x402 doesn't have this)

**Why this matters:** We provide the OUTCOME of chargebacks (agent gets money back) through an insurance mechanism. Same result for agents, different mechanics.

### Real-World Impact

**Recent incidents:**
- October 2025: 402Bridge security breach (USDC disappeared)
- GitHub Issue #545: Python middleware producing 500 errors
- Twitter reports: "x402 protocol API experiencing frequent lags"

**Without insurance:**
- Agent loses 0.01-0.1 USDC per failed API call → funds gone forever
- No recourse, no dispute, no refund
- Add up over many calls = significant losses

**With our insurance:**
- Agent pays 1% premium for protection (e.g., 0.0001 USDC to protect 0.01 USDC)
- If merchant fails: Agent files claim → zkEngine proof → automatic refund in 30 seconds
- Cryptographic proof of fraud → no disputes, no manual review
- Public auditability → anyone can verify we're legitimate
- Only 1% overhead for complete protection

### Differentiation

**vs. x402-secure (t54.ai):**
- **They do:** Pre-transaction risk assessment (prevention)
  - Analyze AI agent context, prompts, model details
  - Assign risk scores (low/medium/high)
  - Prevent fraud before it happens
- **We do:** Post-transaction protection (recovery)
  - Pay refunds when merchant actually fails
  - Prove fraud with zero-knowledge proofs
  - Recover lost funds
- **Relationship:** Complementary, not competitive - use both for maximum protection!

**vs. Traditional insurance:**
- ✅ Instant settlement (30s vs 30 days)
- ✅ No human review required (math proves fraud)
- ✅ Public verifiability (anyone can audit claims)
- ✅ Privacy-preserving (zkp hides sensitive data)
- ✅ Trustless (future: fully on-chain automation)
